# goconquer
### Welcome to my tiny concurrent toolbox!
Once I've written a pattern too many times, it appears here -- modestly featureful, well-tested, and as generic as Go! will allow.

BETTER DOCUMENTATION FORTHCOMING:

### DynamicSelect
Bullet-points:
1) can accept n channels
2) requires interface based channels and functions
3) can load new at run time channels
4) can report what channels are alive
5) cleans up
6) is tested, but end-user code is highly testable.
